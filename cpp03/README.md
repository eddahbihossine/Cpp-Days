## Overview
C++ Day 03 is a continuation of our C++ learning series, building on the knowledge gained in the previous two days. Today, we will delve into more advanced topics, including control structures and functions, which are fundamental in C++ programming.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of C++ Day 03, you should be able to:
- Understand the concept of control structures, including if statements, loops, and switch statements.
- Create and use functions to modularize your code and make it more organized.
- Write C++ programs that make use of these control structures and functions.
- Apply good coding practices to enhance code readability and maintainability.

## Prerequisites
To make the most of C++ Day 03, you should have completed C++ Day 01 and Day 02. It's essential to have a working C++ development environment set up on your computer. If you haven't done this yet, please refer to the setup instructions in the [C++ Day 01 README](link-to-day-01-readme) to get started.

## Activities
1. **Control Structures**: Begin by exploring control structures in C++. Learn how to use if statements for conditional execution, loops (e.g., for, while, and do-while) for repetitive tasks, and switch statements for multiple branching. Practice with small code examples.

2. **Functions**: Dive into the world of functions in C++. Understand how to define functions, pass arguments, and return values. You'll also learn about function prototypes and header files.

3. **Coding Exercises**: Engage in coding exercises to apply what you've learned about control structures and functions. You'll find a set of problems to solve, allowing you to practice your skills.

4. **Project**: Start working on a small project that involves control structures and functions. This project will help you apply these concepts in a real-world context.
